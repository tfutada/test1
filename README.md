# Purpose

Get myself familier with C#, which I feel it's a bit similar to Kotlin.

## C# Functionalities to exam

Regex, Concurrency, Parallel, inheritance

### async/await

Cooking breakfast is a good example of asynchronous work that isn't parallel. One person (or thread) can handle all these tasks.

### Parallel.ForEach

For a parallel algorithm, you'd need multiple cooks (or threads). One would make the eggs, one the bacon, and so on. Each one would be focused on just that one task. Each cook (or thread) would be blocked synchronously waiting for bacon to be ready to flip, or the toast to pop.

## async/wait vs Parallel

Concurrency could be sirial when running on a single thread.

## Regex - date, digit and currency

## Polymorphism
